# Multi-Agent Workflow Architecture Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a multi-agent system for automating data processing and task management using a combination of local and cloud LLMs. The system is designed to optimize accuracy, reduce token usage, and efficiently delegate tasks to specialized agents.

## Agent Architecture

### 1. Director Agent (Orchestrator)
**Role:** Central coordinator and task delegator
**LLM Requirement:** Cloud-based (Claude/GPT-4)

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Task delegation and workflow coordination
- Scheduling and timing management (daily operations)
- High-level decision making
- Error recovery and retry logic
- Agent health/availability monitoring

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- Maintain task queue and priority system
- Handle escalations from other agents
- Keep audit logs of all operations
- Manage resource allocation across agents
- Provide human oversight integration points

### 2. Planner Agent (Strategic)
**Role:** Complex reasoning and task decomposition
**LLM Requirement:** Cloud-based (Claude/GPT-4 for complex reasoning)

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Generate step-by-step instructions for complex tasks
- Break down high-level goals into actionable steps
- Determine optimal task execution order
- Create contingency plans

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- Include dependency mapping between steps
- Add estimated time/complexity for each step
- Generate rollback plans for critical operations
- Consider sub-planners for different domains
- Provide confidence scores for plan quality

### 3. Notion Agent (Operational)
**Role:** Data operations and content management
**LLM Requirement:** Local LLM (Llama 3.2 3B recommended)

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Read post content from various Notion tables
- Categorize content based on context and meaning
- Organize data between tables
- Update status fields and metadata

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- Content validation before categorization
- Duplicate detection logic
- Data consistency checks across tables
- Sub-specialization for different table types
- Batch processing for efficiency

### 4. Validation Agent (Quality Assurance)
**Role:** Output validation and quality control
**LLM Requirement:** Local LLM (Phi-3.5 Mini recommended)

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Verify Notion Agent categorizations are correct
- Check data consistency and completeness
- Validate rule compliance
- Flag items requiring human review

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- Maintain validation rule sets
- Generate quality reports
- Track accuracy metrics over time
- Escalate complex validation issues

## Communication Flow

### Primary Workflow Pattern
```
Director → Planner → Director → Notion Agent(s) → Validation Agent → Director
```

### Data Handoff Strategy
- Use structured JSON schemas for agent communication
- Include confidence scores in all agent outputs
- Add metadata about processing time and resource usage
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Local Agent Failure:** Retry with same agent (max 3 attempts)
2. **Repeated Failure:** Escalate to Director Agent
3. **Complex Cases:** Route to cloud LLM for handling
4. **Critical Failures:** Flag for human intervention

## Local LLM Recommendations
